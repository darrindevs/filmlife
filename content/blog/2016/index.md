**“Recognized” Films I Did See – and disliked for Various Reasons:**
Hacksaw Ridge – One of the primary reasons I disliked the film, was that it had a great, if simple story to tell – BUT it told its story in a predictable, trite and melodramatic script.   Didn’t like the writing.  On top of that, the cinematography was over-the-top and if it’s possible to have melodramatic cinematography, this was it.   This film provided Mel Gibson an opportunity to ingratiate himself with Hollywood liberals – since his theme of the heroic conscientious objector can hardly be disapproved of by either political side.  Considering his history with past films, eg, The Passion of Christ, this project with its “feel good” theme must have been a great relief to him.
