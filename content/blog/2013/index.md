It turns out, in retrospect, that 2013 was a spectacular year for film.  

**Susan’s Top Eleven…** No particular Ranking

- Her 
- Blue Jasmine
- Nebraska
- Don Jon
- Leviathan - documentary
- All Is Lost
- American Hustle
- Dallas Buyers Club
- The Spectacular Now
- The Way Way Back
- Twenty Feet From Stardom – documentary, nominated
- (Inside Llewyn Davis) – This is the film that introduced Oscar Isaac to the greater public; and he’s been going ever since.  

**And the next several, interesting, not quite top for me…**

- Short Term Twelve
- Gravity
- Wolf of Wall Street – Yep. I’m on the other side from those who absolutely love “The Wolf”.  Bet the book is fun!

**I failed to see, among others:**

- Twelve Years A Slave
- Captain Philips
- Philomena

For some reason, wanted to see Delivery Man. Good premise…

Have seen only one 2013 nominated feature documentary!
