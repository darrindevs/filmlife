For some reason, 2017 was the year for remarkable acting performances across the board.   Every year there are a few stand-out performances.  But this year, I found myself marveling at the journeys actors undertook, and the places they arrived in intimate, rare and deep performances 


**1) Get Out**

If a measure of the power of film is its ability to viscerally transmit the experiences and emotions of the characters on the screen to those in the audience, then Get Out, has got it. The film provides us the gift to imaginatively live another life without having to incur the work, risks, dangers that life entails.   And for many of us, living the direct experience of being born black in contemporary white-dominated American society, isn’t available…   Sadly, it is available to the millions of black citizens at any traffic stop.   For the rest of us Jordan Peele, the film’s writer and director, has provided a version of it for us.  Scary.   

Integral to Peale’s effectiveness in delivering pure terror is his blend of two genres: horror and comedy.  In one of his other lives, Peale is a stand-up comedian.  This is a script of great originality, written from the gut.    It is nominated in 

**2) 3 Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri**

Anyone who has seen the writer Martin McDonagh’s work for stage (eg, The Beauty Queen of Leenane, the Cripple of Inishmaan or the Lieutenant of Inishneer) has received ample warning.  This guy does not mince words.   He goes for the jugular.  For the rest of you, take a friend to the screening.  3 Billboards is a roller coaster ride.   McDonagh, who wrote and directed the film (his first film direction), is joined by Frances McDormand’s amazing performance.  In transcendent acting, the actor becomes the person.  No holds barred.  No compromises.  For me, wonderful.

•The virtuosity of the scriptwriting – and it is a virtuoso piece - lies in its dialogue and in the surprising character “turns” that McDonagh pulls off.  McDonough does not stoop to stereotypes.  You think you know a character and then the character reveals something deeper – and amazing.   This is particularly true for Sam Rockwell’s depiction of Dixon, a prejudiced police officer; and of Woody Harrelson’s Willoughby, Dixon’s boss.  Each character goes to places one would not expect – which gives the film a great plot.   Beyond that, the film’s theme of the possibility for change and kindness in a brutal world, is one I, for one, need to see in life.  But the screen is a start.  Rockwell and Harrelson are each nominated for best supporting actor, competing against each other.    


**3) Visages – Villages (Faces and Places)**

•There was Laurel and Hardy, and Abbot and Costello; and Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire; and Buster Keaton and the stout-hearted lady who joins him in The General.  And now there’s tiny Agnes Varda with her red-and-white bowl cut hair and her partner-in-crime, the tall, lanky French photographer, J.R.   

•In the film world, it is known that Godard has been capable of being snide and cruel a rat – and for our edification, he is one in this film.   Yes, Jean-Luc, I’m speaking to you.   If you want to know of the specifics, I can supply one or two – in addition to the ending Godard supplies in Faces.  

**4) Call Me by Your Name**

Adapted from a novel by André Aciman

**5) Coco**

•Oh, Pixar!  You sure do know how to design characters for the screen.   Supporting characters, even in brief appearances suggest detailed, intricate and absorbing lives, characters we know, we have met, or at least seen.   Pixar character design and movement are societal commentary in themselves, whether in the land of the living or the dead.   And this film traverses both.   

The inspired, under-appreciated artist at the margins of society who lives his magical life in obscurity – and in the case of   I feel like writing the entire list of characters that Pixar brings to the screen in pointed, well-observed vignettes.    But there is no time.

The script is a “three-hanky” script, a weeper.   And what makes us weep?  The film’s simple, universal theme: Do not forget those whom you love.  In addition, the script’s world creation of  cinematic worlds: the Mexico of the living – its vibrancy – and the world of the Dead - is extravagant imagination at its best.   

**6) Lady Bird**

Yes, of course, Lady Bird.  An “independent film” from the New York-based and influenced Greta Gerwig.  Her boyfriend is the film director, Noah Baumbach, who also wrote and directed a memorable film this year, The Meyerowitz Stories.   Baumbach is known for his breakthrough film, the Squid and the Whale.   But this year is Gerwig’s year.   The film is nominated for best picture.   What is arresting about the script is Gerwig’s capture of a series of sharp, poignant moments that capture “life” without any “good-for-you” theme.    And the moments are pointedly observed – and to a limited extent, autobiographically-based.

**7) Shape of Water**

In his review for the New Yorker, film critic, Anthony Lane marvels at the fact that this film “should not have “worked” as a film.   And, furthermore, as Lane accurately points out, the script is essentially a “Creature from the Black Lagoon” derivative.   No accident.  Guillermo del Toro, the film’s writer and director is a deep fan of the 1954 slimy epic in which a monstrous creature falls for a “beautiful maiden.”   We’ve seen the scenario before:  It is Beauty and the Beast; it is King Kong.  And now it’s The Shape of Water.   

But what is so fascinating about this film is precisely what I believe does make it work: del Toro’s phenomenally detailed visual and metaphorical imagination.  It is an imagination that works “in the cracks” between the film’s story, showing us moments like the following: drops of rain streaming down a window pane on which del Toro lingers.   It is the visual world that he creates that holds us, not so much the story.     

**8) Dunkirk**

This is a film shot in 70mm that does place on the screen the breadth and scale of the film’s depiction of the rescue of 300,000 British troops from the Nazis.   The script’s division into three parts: land, air and water is smart.   And Churchill’s final “we-shall-fight-you” speech, is the most stirring rendition of that speech.   Although it should be noted that it was used in another 2017 film in Gary Oldman’s depiction of Churchill in Darkest Hour, practically a one-man performance piece.   But for me, Darkest Hour worked too hard for effects 

**9) The Disaster Artist**

•A lot of outrageous fun by the Judd Apatow alum, James Franco!!   Making fun of the difficulties in drawing lines between insanity, pretention and art.   The search for “truth” gets left by the wayside.  Way to go Franco!!   He is ably supported by Seth Rogan, another buddy from the days when they both worked for Judd Apatow.    

**10) The Meyerowitz Stories**

In this film, the characters played by Adam Sandler and Dustin Hoffman as a father-and-son duo in which through most of the film, Hoffman’s narcissistic father practically destroys the son’s chance for a life of his own.   

Beautiful, beautiful, well-observed writing, Noah Baumbach.   Baumbach is a writer-director who “crushes” family dynamics.   Or at least the dynamic of a certain kind of family.  

**11) The Florida Project**

A great visual appreciation of poverty, desperation and Florida.    



#### Special Mentions:

- Roman J. Israel

•Denzel Washington portrays this idealist loser gone wrong.   A painful, remarkable portrait. Root with me for Denzel to win Best Actor for Roman J.  

- Marshall 

**Lucky**

2017 is the year that Harry Dean Stanton died.  But before he did that, he gave us one last performance in the film, Lucky, which was written specifically for him.   It is an excruciating and for me, intensely private pleasure simply to witness Harry Dean Stanton’s frail figure make its way across the screen, particularly when he’s crossing the desert, in silence, dressed in his underwear.   But no matter what he’s wearing, or where he’s wearing it, Stanton’s body language is eloquent.   Lucky was written for Stanton and at age 91, Stanton took it on, playing the lead.  It was his final film.   He died in 2017.   

Stanton’s every movement testifies simultaneously to human vulnerability and human determination.   Throughout his career of more than 200 film roles, most supporting roles, but some leads: Repro Man, Paris, Texas and now Lucky, it is as though Stanton has been making one film, one cinematic statement.   Whatever that statement is, it is the visual expression of a Samuel Beckett novel or play.    Beckett won the Nobel Prize in Literature.   They don’t have that for actors.   But if they did, Stanton and Lucky would earn my vote.    

**Ken Burns Vietnam War**

The best researched, edited and written documentary sequences.   The interviews alone that A classic.

**Phantom Thread**

•Why can’t I place this film in my top 10 list for 2017 when so many film critics have listed it?   Particularly, since I am a deep admirer of so much of writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson’s previous work???   And in addition, the film speaks to artists and their needs with rare, detailed understanding??  And it’s careful in its depiction of small subtleties, of moments.  It has all that going for it, not to mention Daniel Day Lewis’ much announced “final performance”…    BUT 

**Briefly, **
ultimately I don’t find the film script’s ending credible.   The love relationship is credible all the way to the final scene – and then Anderson leaps off an unmotivated, cliff.   The cliff crumbles under us.   It’s a big “How??” (“How does the character know?”) 
I saw it in 70mm.   Unlike Dunkirk, Anderson does not put 70mm worth of film on the screen.



**Logan Lucky**

•There are a number of tiny crazy things about this film, in which one wants to ask Steven Soderburgh, the film’s director, “Why’d you do this?”  Even the title is awkward and peculiar: Logan Lucky vs. the standard, easily stated “Lucky Logan.”  But that’s the point.  Soderburgh isn’t a standard director.  He’s a renegade.   He’s the director who’s been making the Magic Mike male stripper films with Channing Tatum.    And Channing Tatum stars in this one.   He’s a director who is loyal to his “film family”.    

In this case, Tatum is joined by the astounding Daniel Craig - possibly my favorite James Bond of all time.  (Craig gives Sean Connery’s take on Bond a run for the money.)   Craig, who is a British actor, shows up in this film with an astounding Southern accent and in prison garb.  He wears the stripes well.   The entire film is worth it to watch Craig perform perfect, military-style push-ups.  Soderburgh is a kinky appreciator of male beauty.   And I’m on board.  

But let’s not forget that Soderburgh’s also the director who won the Academy Award for Traffic; and whose breakthrough film Sex, Lies and Videotape remains a classic worth watching today.
