Most years I compile a list of my favorite films.   And so, pre-Oscars, here is this year’s thinking.   
    
In many ways, this was a dark and somewhat sobering year at the movies.    , Reflecting hard economic times and various individual-societal disruptions??  Who knows, all I know is that the films that rang true with me were by-and-large, dark.  That said, there were a number of really good films released in 2014 - at least, through this viewer’s lenses.     My list is only marginally in sync with Oscar nominations.

**COMMENTS, RANDOM THOUGHTS**

*Ida* – Quite simply, my top favorite of the year.   A small film, incredible intensity.    Beautiful use of black & white film.   

*Inherent Vice* – 
01/16/15
I wanted to list the film, based solely upon my admiration for Anderson’s insane approach to making movies…. 

01/19.15   
Viewed the film:  The above leap of faith, more than justified.  The film’s atmospheric, run-down, hallucinatory production values & cinematography may be nudging Ida out of  1st place in my heart - and into second.  Or at least a tie.    Idealists, I apologize.   Great uses of Southern California locations.   

A nostalgic return to the drug-infused, make-it-up-as-you-go, 1970’s era.     Joaquin Phoenix makes the most of his unique hair and face in the film, as does the camera.     Reading the Pynchon novel upon which the film is based, may qualify as an additional pleasure, should you have the time to read novels these days:  Bravo.

*Whiplash* – My third favorite film of the year, but undoubtedly, for private and possibly purely idiosyncratic reasons - although it’s holding its own at the box office with a respectable run (in this era of disappearing films).   Made by a former Harvard film student, Whiplash, a small film produced with modest resources (no “stars”, simple sets/locations), maintains extraordinary intensity – and pace.  After all, this is about a drummer and what is drumming essentially about other than pace, tempo?     Note: one of the film’s secrets:  the muscle of Jason Reitman working as producer.    Yay, Reitman – a talented director in his own right.    

The film raises many interesting questions, particularly for those who plan a career in the arts.   I could start listing those questions; most semesters, my students & I discuss them.    Taken all together, a profound, simultaneously depressing and  exhilarating meditation on the ultimate question: What is required for success in the art world?   Or perhaps in any world?

*Citizenfour* – A beautifully produced, shot and edited documentary.   And producing this baby was no small feat.   After all, the film is about a fugitive in hiding from the U.S. government, and filmed by a filmmaker living in Berlin in chosen exile, in heavy surveillance by the government (reason for chosen exile).  

And, of course, the subject matter is “secret” yet crucial for all current American & world “ordinary” citizens.   However, it is the intimate portrait of a man on the run who has made an irrevocable and compelling decision with respect to Government rogue policies and his conscience.   Awe-inspiring.   Some people make choices the rest of us lack opportunity, skills or courage to make.   This guy displays all three.

*Only Lovers Left Alive* – Jim Jarmusch.   Tilda Swinton in long blond wig.  Hipster vampires.   An experienced, jaded view of the world.   And, the eternal ethical vampire problem: they live on others.  But, in some sense or all senses, who doesn’t?   Locations: Tangier & Detroit.  Hip.  What can I say?

*The One I Love* – A clever script premise, the kind called “high concept”.   And a meditation on marriage choices.  

*The Drop* – Potentially classic noir for those who are fans – Great, great writing by Dennis Lehane in the original short story;  although the story provides a nearly unbearable read and thinking about life.    Mostly perfect casting, including an incredible penultimate performance by James Gandolfini.      

*Fury* – A World War II story, containing perfectly written sequences, each sequence a short story in itself and moral tale.    I so admired the writing of the script sequences.  

*Nightcrawler* –  Jake Gyllenhall so creepy, and such a creepy view of television news operation.  And the use of self-reflexive camera sequences imbedded within the film – camera within camera – provides a cinematography thrill for me.     

*A Most Wanted Man* -  Phillip Seymour Hoffman (with a strange accent) in a strange, penultimate role as a German spymaster.   The film is a nod to a classic form of the noir genre so absent in current films.  Great noir  lighting, cinematography.   

*Love is Strange* – Ira Sachs, who takes us into the very real and specific worlds of gay love, gay marriage and the economic struggle of apartment living in New York.   Previously,  Sachs made a fascinating, intimate low budget film about a downer gay love relationship which took place in New York, of course.   This film is a up triumph.   

*Boyhood* – The kind of film that many documentarians think they should make.  But Linklater did it.  And as a fiction film.   While charting the aging of his actors over 12 years.   A fascinating merger of fiction and fact, documentary.  

**RUNNERS UP, OF INTEREST, for a variety of reasons:**

*Two Days, One Night*:  (Belgium with strong French partnership) – Great observations on enduring problems in the human condition:  the crucial role of work as income generator, and self-worth generator - particularly in the current economy; personal battles with depression  and despair; social network support – or lack of it;  all of these are simply and beautifully depicted.   Not to mention, the prime script conflict, experiment: placing characters in a situation of difficult-to-impossible choices – and seeing how they behave.    

*Birdman* – Will state at some other time why even though this film is strong on the awards circuit,  for me, Birdman is in the “runner up” category, in spite of its hallucinogenic qualities, particularly Birdman, the internal delusion who wreaks so much destruction & possibly salvation on the external world, that he may (as well) be real.   An astute commentary upon each our internal lives and their effect upon our external lives.   In spite of this wonderful  correlation, I the script did not quite hold together as a unified whole.   

Absolutely brilliant work by its cast.    My favorite performance:  Ed Norton’s, not Michael Keaton’s.    But this is Keaton’s year to be recognized by the film industry, and he’s good.   

*Force Majeure* –  The film operates in those small, subtle areas of human ambivalence & ambiguities that have huge consequences in terms of human relationships and their meaning.    

*Enough Said* – Touching and, at the same time standard operating territory.
