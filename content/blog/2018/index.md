description: This was My Year at the Movies
---

NOTE: There are several elements about this year in film that distinguish it from previous years.  

1) First, this was a year in which, film critics from the most prestigious papers sometimes seemed to be seeing different films than the rest of American viewers.  Just check the New Yorker or New York Times critics lists versus the best film vote on Rotten Tomatoes.   Or maybe it was only the East Coast critics who were seeing films to which most of us had little or no theatrical access for most of the year.  If you blinked, they were gone.   Or they never showed up in your town in the first place.   I wonder how many you saw?

2) Then, near the year’s end, a stunning and welcome phenomenon occurred: some of the tantalizing, but unavailable films have been offered on screening services prior to the awards season: primarily Amazon and Netflix - and, in one case, on PBS.  Previously, this has been a “no-no”.   The idea has always been to drive viewers to theaters where those precious dollars can be pried loose.  What gives now?    Of course, now, precious dollars can be spent on streaming services…  a great enticement to membership.   And, also, streaming services have produced (read: “funded”) some of the major Oscar contenders.   Apart from the tiny screens, this is good for those of us who do not live in NYC or LA.  I hope that this is a trend that continues.

3) A third notable surprise – and a welcome one, is how many of these films, often mainstream, large audience, studio-funded films are using experimental formal approaches writing, cinematography & editing to tell their stories.   Risky.  Fun.  Personally, I love it.   New formal ideas are the single element that get my bottom in the theater seat and keep it there.   And there were a lot this year.

NOTE: The List Below does NOT represent my predictions for who will win Oscar statuettes on February 24th.   Nor does this list pay attention to Academy categories (best script, best director, best film, best foreign film, etc.).   The list below simply represents the films released in 2018 that I have seen and think are valuable viewing.    

Thanks to everyone who spent time watching & discussing films with me this past year!   And a special thanks to my two special film buddies: Janet Beizer & Nancy Salzer!!

THE LIST

**Capernaum** – Lebanon

The remarkable film Capernaum, which depicts the plight of children in so many nations of the Middle East, brought into the world only to be starved, brutalized and abandoned.  After this cheery description, don’t want to see the film??   Oh no, you’re wrong.   The direction, action and scriptwriting are refreshing, uplifting.   How is this possible?   The script is structured around a “wrap-around” story (device) of a court case  in which a twelve year-old child takes his parents to court for the crime of “giving birth” to him and his brothers and sisters.   An innovative concept dreamed up by Nadine Labaki.  Although I’m now wondering if there may have been such a case in the Lebanese courts(?)  

However, for me, better than its concept and the way Capernaum unfurls its tragic story, is its avoidance of cliché.   Particularly, for those of us who wince at the deep rut of cliché that Hollywood has dug for itself in story-telling.    For example, in a scene in which Zain, the film’s resourceful 12 year-old protagonist is running away on a bus.  The empty seat beside him is filled by a peculiar old man dressed in a strange homemade costume that might be taken for Spiderman.  When he engages the child hero in conversation, I found myself cringing at the obligatory “child molestation” scene that surely was to come.  But no, the man wants to speak about his costume.   “I may look like him, but I am not who you think I am,” he shares with the boy – or words to that effect.   “No”, he confides, he is “Cockroach Man”.    The film is filled with such moments that deviate from expectation. There is a moment between the film’s hero and a large sculpture at the center of the tilt-a-whirl, worthy of Fellini (an observation made by Claudio).   

But nothing beats Capernaum’s theme: the miraculous story of a child able to maintain his wisdom and humanity in a vicious and inhuman world – which these days is true of so much of the globe.  

**Shoplifters** – Japan
 
This film about a miscellaneous band of characters, living as a makeshift family on the margins of society – “a grandmother”, “a father & mother,” a teenage girl, a pre-teen boy and eventually a young girl of kindergarten or first grade age - may well be my favorite of in a year.   They have happily, slipped under society’s radar.   One of the ways, they survive is given away in the film’s intriguing title.   We see fragments from each character’s life; and these compelling moments, when assembled form a composite story.  This formal device is not unlike the film’s casually mentioned central metaphor, a children’s book, titled: Swimmy the Fish.  Swimmy which is about a group of tiny fish who band together to fight off giant fish predator, who tries to eat them.   I was particularly delighted to see the story of “Swimmy” providing the metaphor for both the film’s content and for its striking narrative device of fragments into a narrative whole.   The book was written and illustrated by the left-wing Italian artist, Leo Lionni, who is the father of my college friend, Barbara’s husband, Mannie Lionni.  As soon as I saw the film, I contacted Mannie and Barbara, to let them know that Mannie’s father’s book played a small, interesting role the film.   They already knew.  But the book, dropped so randomly into the film’s story, like so many other seemingly random but compelling moments, is central to the film’s potent political and human statement.    The script’s achingly intimate moments snap into a vivid and coherent whole, just as the many tiny fish in Swimmy snap into a vivid and coherent whole to defeat the predator.

However, the film’s conclusion is not as happy as Swimmy’s: the failure of individuals and of our solutions to defeat the larger predator corporate state, becomes heart-breakingly clear when a plot twist near the film’s end, re-frames the film’s narrative focus – and provides a seismic shift in our understanding as well.  Suddenly, we, the viewers and the miscellaneous band of characters are cruelly yanked from the intimate close-up reality that we have been experiencing and loving into the “long-shot” of society’s larger social judgments and agendas.  Standard “societal” interpretations and expectations betray the loving vision this little band of outsiders has created – as is so often is the case.   Shoplifters is a masterful voyage through powerful story-telling and the love of miscellaneous characters for each other.  What more can you want?  

**Vice**

With its double-edged title, Vice makes its potent point.   Adam McKay loves words and he is just as good with images.  Both serve the film’s incredible tone that simultaneously makes it a comedy and a tragedy.   Just look at the scene, encapsulated in one of the trailer cuts, where George W. Bush proposes to Dick Cheney that Cheney serve as his Vice-President.  It’s all there.

Like other films this year, Vice is structured in small fragments.  Each fragment provides an insight, moves the needle further.   One critic dismissed the film as a “series of Saturday Night skits strung together.”  With that assessment, the critic dismisses himself from consideration of any sort.   The film’s story of behind-the-scenes politics gathers momentum as it moves along – powered by Christian Bale and supporting actor performances to treasure: Steve Carrell’s Donald Rumsfeld, and the perfection of Sam Rockwell’s “W.”   The film’s most alarming message should be taken seriously by those who are eager to impeach Trump:  Beware of the Vice.  No: wait out Trump.  Don’t set up Pence.  I admired this film, just as I admired McKay’s The Big Short.  Great economic and political filmmaking designed to power social change.   Wish a film could do it.  If it could, McKay is the man.

**Roma**

From the powerful opening scene of Roma, in which we see something that at first we cannot identify: water washing a floor, we know that we are in the hands of a director who is powerfully visual – and in control of the camera: Alfonso Cuarón.   Amazingly, Cuarón is literally in control of the camera.  He is his own cinematographer for the film!  When does that happen?  Never.   Cuarón is writer, director and cinematographer for the film, which is a memoir from his own childhood.  This is a highly personal and touching film.  The evocation of the past provides justification for shooting in black-and-white; even though the past that Cuarón evokes is the 1970’s, a color film era….  Oh well, I’ll accept it.

Always best about Cuarón’s films are the infinitesimally small human observations that he makes: 1) the constant battle with dog shit in the driveway; 2) the M.D. father who has abandoned the family, but as the pregnant maid arrives in labor, suddenly magically appears in the hospital to run alongside her, providing belated natural childbirth coaching.  Cuarón’s great humanity shines through each of his films.  This is pleasant, touching, a pleaser.  But my favorite Cuarón’s film remains Y Tu Mama Tambien.  If you haven’t seen it, do.  

**American Animals**

This free-wheeling heist film is based upon an actual attempted theft of an Audubon original folio by 4 college-aged guys in the 1990’s.    The film is inventive in its use of film language in oh- so-many-ways, utilizing its base of true incident to explore documentary-fiction relations.  Each of the central characters is doubled: the actual guys and the actors who play them; while the film’s narrative is mostly carried by actors, the original documentary characters appear; and they comment on the scenes to us as well as to the actors

Throughout the film, documentary interviews with the real characters who committed the heist are intercut with the fictionalized film story.  The characters sometime periodically weigh in on the story’s progress and whether the filmmakers have gotten it right.   They also interact with the actors who portray them.   The director has interesting mechanisms for achieving the film’s thrilling transitions between fictional and factual worlds.  It is too complex and time consuming to describe in detail these mechanisms here.  But his ideas are worth an in-depth examination. The camera feels perfectly free to operate any way it chooses.  The opening sequence with its upside-down shots of Audubon prints is a perfect example.  And the tight choreography between cinematography and editing has crystal-perfect timing.   This is editing as “diamond-cutting,” to quote a producer for whom I once worked.   However, some of the ideas may be in the script??   

The script asks and examines the question present in certain lives: “Do you ever feel like you’re waiting for something to happen?  That thing that could make your life special?”  A good question.   Its answer is the rest of the film.    Note: Also, a great period music track…   In my book, this film is absolutely the most over-looked and under-rated of this year’s crop.  

**Can You Ever Forgive Me?**

Let me say: Melissa McCarthy!!  Fell for her in the very funny, very commercial comedy, Bridesmaids – with her leg across an airplane aisle, insisting to a passing male on being laid.  Perhaps not to everyone’s taste.   But she won my heart.    With this film, she broke it.   McCarthy plays Lee Israel, the talented and enterprising writer who due to abject poverty, is driven to forgery of famous author letters complete with signatures.   The letters, sold at a high price, became collectors’ items.  We’re talking about such inimitable wits as Noel Coward, Dorothy Parker, etc.   Apparently, not inimitable to Lee Israel.  And if you can write bon mots as well or better than Coward or Parker, surely you should be exempt from prison.   But such was not the case for Israel.  Yes, the oh-so-knowing and understated script, like so many this year, was adapted from life.   The film is brilliant, as is its male supporting actor, Richard E. Grant.   If the film were not so small, but more of a “blockbuster”, perhaps it would be a “contender” on Oscar night.   But such a film never is.   However, perhaps Grant and McCarthy stand a chance in the actors’ categories.  They certainly deserve it.

**The Wife** 

In 2018, two important films about the complex relations of women, men and art were released: The Wife and A Star is Born.   An issue of deep interest to any female operating within the art world.   A Star is Born in a sense provides the clichéd answer of love, success and self-destruction.  The Wife sadly depicts a case of art “forgery” of an entirely different magnitude and type, in which the crime is committed by the victim against herself.   Much more nuanced.  Think this is unusual?  Untrue?  Perhaps the circumstance is enlarged, made painfully clear, but throughout history, sometimes - perhaps often - women have received the ironic testimony of “I owe everything to…” without the credit.   A painful film to watch: the indictment is of the exploiter and of the complicit exploited.   

**A Star is Born + GaGa & Cooper interviews + GaGa Netflix documentary**

Like Black Panther, A Star is Born is a huge cultural phenomenon.   Everywhere I go, women are telling me that they are in love with Bradley Cooper.  In this film, is it the film’s corny text that resonates?   Or its subversive subtext?   More on that later.

But first, let’s look at the film’s cinematic merits.  Camera, Camera, Camera.   This film sweeps the viewer into a magic world with its opening sequence:  through a free-form use of the camera.  Wisely, Cooper, as Director, opens with bravura performances: his own, the back-up musicians and his cinematographer’s.   The concert sections of the film are shot like concert footage from the great documentarians of the cinema verité movement: Don Pennebaker, Richard Leacock, Al Maysles.   And there’s a reason for that: the concert footage is a “run-and-gun” shoot.   This means that the cinematographer, shot documentary-style while Bradley Cooper actually performed in short stints “as a rock star” at such iconic real musical events as Glastonbury and Coachella.  He was given a few minutes between acts during which he performed for crowds of tens-of-thousands.   No re-takes.   That takes guts.   Or another part of the anatomy.   

This style of shooting requires a lot of energy and in-the-moment insights – and Cooper’s cinematographer, Matthew Libatique, provides the energy and glamour.  Libatique also masters intimate close-up shot work between Cooper and Lady Gaga, that permits viewers to be part of love scenes, from a rare privileged view.  Viewers are part of the love scene.  I believe that it is partly this that provided the film’s overwhelming popularity.    This and Lady Gaga and Cooper’s erotic chemistry, of course.   

It’s certainly not the script, which contains the clichés we’d all like to believe: the unattractive woman with talent will win the guy and his love;  or that although the rest of the world may believe Stephani Joanne Angelina Germanotta (Lady Gaga) to have the wrong face, Bradley Cooper’s character believes she’s beautiful.   And how fortunate for Cooper that he was able to recruit Lady Gaga.   She gives the film everything, including, her powerful vocal chords – and, of course, her vulnerability.   (Note: For her, Hollywood and the rest of us, vulnerability consists of going without make-up.)

And this is where the film’s importance lies for me:  It is a clash between the trite text and the underlying truths of its subtext; its overt message and covert message.   In the firestorm of press & tv interviews that Bradley Cooper & Lady Gaga provided during the film’s release period, we see the difference between female super-stardom (Gaga) and male super-stardom (Cooper).   At home, he has a Russian super-model waiting for him – and a brand-new new baby daughter.   As she states in a Netflix documentary, when she goes home, she’s “alone”.   Perhaps that’s currently changed?  I don’t know.   The blurred reality of “life facts” versus “fiction facts” provides the film’s real interest.  Mind vs. Matter.   The film is not whole without its context.  Cooper and Gaga’s self-creations are fascinating – and must be seen in accompanying context.   There are scores of interviews that provide that context.  Examples just scratch the surface:

**First Man**

In the past six years, writer-director, Damien Chazelle has made three major feature films, one of them winning him the “Best Director” Oscar (La La Land) – which at the age of 32, made him the youngest director to receive that award.    

All three of Chazell’s films share at least one common, pressing concern: 
The high personal cost paid by those doing ground-breaking, original work, whether in the arts or sciences.   As a necessary corollary to the proposition that there is a price to be paid for great originality and ambition, Chazelle’s films also explore the qualities of soul required for the person who undertakes such a venture, whether it is in music (Whiplash and La La Land), acting (La La Land) or walking on the moon (First Man).   

Glad to have seen this film with Claudio Marcotulli, who shares Chazelle’s attention to cinematic detail, critiquing Chazelle on a summer swimming pool scene full of pop colors, saying, “I wouldn’t have brought up the color so much in that scene.”   It is only a director who makes such choices, who excites such detailed observation in his viewers.   And Chazelle is such a director.   

**Leave No Trace**

A small beautiful gem of a film about a father and daughter that discusses a rare and heartbreaking situation.    The father has raised his daughter in secrecy, in the wilderness away from civilization because he has a pathological aversion to people.  As children must, she shares her father’s living choices.   But as the daughter becomes a teenager (she is 13), through an accident that betrays them, she discovers another way to live - and wishes to live life in a home, among people.  In other words, she must choose between her father and the rest of civilized society.   Beautifully written and directed by Deborah Granik.   

**Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse – The Cinematic Marvel Universe**

I saw this film with my daughter and grandsons, Zack and Finn.  Even Finn, seven-years old, recognized what is remarkable about this film: its stunning, stunning graphic ideas.  Spider combines the old-time comic homage with super-sophisticated, abstract, up-to-the-minute graphic appreciations and ideas.    And its simultaneously hackneyed (we’ve seen this before, haven’t we?), but “off-the-charts” use of the concept of “alternate universes” allows it to arrive at some interesting moments as well as its “feel good” conclusion.    Hope it takes the Oscar in animation.   More interesting, more energetic than Isle of Dogs and other contenders.   Nonetheless, Wes Anderson, I’m still a fan.

**THE OAKLAND, CA. SERIES**

Who thinks of Oakland, California as a film production capitol?   And, yet, in 2018, at least three major films were either based in Oakland and/or have referenced Oakland.   And the principal talents responsible for writing or directing these films are Oakland-based.  Who knew?   

•Blindspotting 
The opening sequence of this film in which the fictional characters  walk through a documentary Oakland alone makes the price of admission worthwhile.   

•Sorry to Bother You: 
Loved, loved to pieces the brilliant first half of this film, a dead-accurate, razor-sharp indictment of our commercial, consumer market economy.   But I hated the latter part of the film, which departs into a surrealist fantasy.    Summary: A film split in two: Strong first half; weak second half. 

•(Black Panther – See Notes in  “ALSO WORTH NOTING”

**THE DOCS**

•Hale County, This Morning, This Evening, RaMell Ross
I first saw the remarkable film, Hale County, Morning, Evening in Cambridge at a “DocYards” screening at the Brattle theater.   The film was shot by a still photographer, RaMell Ross, who used heavily defined formal rules and constraints to make this film.   I don’t have time or energy currently to tell you what is extraordinary about this film.   Let me say: Hale County required a lot of work on the part of the maker(s) to arrive where it has aesthetically - and equal work on the part of the viewer to arrive there with it.   For me, it is worth the work.   

If other films this year tell their stories in fragments, Hale County tells its story in images and split seconds.   This is possible if a film’s story is being told primarily through the camera.   And this film’s story is.  Nonetheless, I am fascinated to see that RaMell has a co-writer listed, Maya Krinsky.   

In the Q-and-A section following the Brattle screening, RaMell discussed the film’s constraints that he had devised to work with, “Oh, rules, so many rules…”    These rules can be decoded if you take the time.

After the screening, on an extremely rainy Cambridge night, RaMell bought me a drink.   I ordered a coke.  If I had known about the Academy nomination, RaMell, I would have ordered champagne.   Almost undoubtedly, RBG will take the Oscar in documentary.   But Hale County, This Morning, This Evening has made the breakthrough to new territory.   You can see it on the PBS website, for Independent Lens.   There can be no lens more independent than RaMell’s.

**Three Identical Strangers**

This is a documentary that is fascinating on at least two counts: 1) It is a documentary with actual narrative plot turns;  and a theme or themes; and, of course with three protagonists – and perhaps an equal number of villains.   So, the film shares more elements with fiction film. than with documentary – and I welcome that.   2) the story that it tells is truly criminal and heartbreaking.   Loved this film.  
 
**Filmworker**

This film about Leon Vitale, who worked for and with Stanley Kubrick for decades: unsung, underpaid and essentially sacrificed his life to film - or to be specific to Stanley Kubrick films -  is surely a cautionary tale regarding hero worship, the film industry – and what each can inevitably exact.  

**Mr. Rogers**
This film left me feeling so hopeful for humanity, that I simply had to include it.   Yay, for Fred Rogers!  A pleasure to watch.   

**ALSO WORTH NOTING**

Some of these films are so good, so worth noting, with such interesting elements, I ask myself: “why could I not put them into the list at the top?”    But, the truth is, I found the films above more compelling for me in one way or another than the films below.  Nonetheless, each of the films below has outstanding qualities.   What a year in film!!

**Bohemian Rhapsod**y
What Music!!  Although I was not a Queens fan at the time….   And what a performance by Rami Malek!  If a performance by a single actor can carry a film, Malek’s is it!

**Black Panther**
The opening week of this film was a true cultural phenomenon.    As word-of-mouth spread, tickets sold out.  When a film does this, it’s exciting to be a part of it.   I was fortunate to attend a packed midnight show with Thomas, a former student and his friend, Codey.   As a child, Codey had been a collector of Marvel Comic Books, knew everything about the Marvel Universe, and particularly, The Black Panther.  And it appeared, so did a lot of the audience.   Marvel fans were out in force to celebrate a black universe that starts in Oakland, California and sweeps us into the mythological kingdom of Wakanda hidden somewhere on the continent of Africa, a dream world no less compelling than Shangri-La.   Maybe it was the hour, maybe it was the audience, maybe it was Codey’s coaching re: Marvel Lore, but I left the theater exhilarated.

NOTE: Black Panther director, Ryan Coogler, who directed Fruitvale Station, is yet another Oakland filmmaker (see p. 6).    

**Cold War** 
This is a film by Polish director, Pawel Pawlikowski, who made one of my favorite films of all-time, 2013’s Ida, which won the Academy Award for “best foreign film” that year.  But in spite of Pawlikowski’s use of stunning black-and-white film, a gorgeous lead actress and a grim political context, this tale of East German Communism, so compelling in its political depiction and critique, fell short in its central love story: a story of love as senseless addiction.   And for me, that ended my affection for the film long before the protagonists reached their end.   

**Blackkklansman**
That scene in which we get to watch a clip of D.W. Griffiths’ Birth of a Nation from the p-o-vs of both Klu Klux Klan members and Ron Stalworth, a black FBI operative - as well as black staff is riveting.  Spike Lee has changed the meaning of screenings of that film in film history classes forever.  Or at least I hope so.   

**Death of Stalin**
This is Communism as comedy, a “communist comedy”:  of bureaucratic ambition and obsequience” the film is an indictment of the absurdity of Russian Communism under Stalin.  And, by extension, certainly, under Putin   But for my money – and it’s been a long time – it's a distant second to the sublime Greta Garbo in the 1939 “communist comedy,” Ninotchka.  Which was a better critique of Communist values versus Capitalist values.  But of course, now Communist values are identical to Capitalist values…
